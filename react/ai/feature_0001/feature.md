# Feature 0001: Chat Experience Improvements

## Problem Statement
Current chat functionality has several user experience issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Welcome Message Display**: The first welcome message is not consistently displayed when a user ends and starts a new call
2. **Raw Tag Display**: Raw `<trl-` tags sometimes appear in the chat instead of being properly processed/hidden
3. **Chat History Persistence**: Chat history is lost when users disconnect and reconnect, requiring page refresh to clear

## Requirements

### 1. Welcome Message Display
- Ensure the first welcome message appears every time a user starts a new call
- Message should be consistent and properly formatted
- Should work reliably across connection/disconnection cycles

### 2. Tag Processing
- Prevent raw `<trl-` tags from appearing in the chat interface
- Ensure proper parsing/filtering of message content
- Handle cases where tags are sometimes visible, sometimes overwritten

### 3. Chat History Persistence
- Maintain chat history during the user session
- Clear history only on page refresh
- Persist through connection/disconnection cycles
- Do not persist across browser sessions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Welcome message appears consistently on every new call
- [ ] No raw `<trl-` tags visible in chat interface
- [ ] Chat history maintained until page refresh
- [ ] Chat functionality works smoothly across connect/disconnect cycles

## Technical Scope
- Focus on chat-related components (likely `RtmChatPanel.js` and `useAgoraRTM.jsx`)
- May involve connection state management
- Message parsing and filtering logic
- Session-based storage (not localStorage)
